	+eventDescription("Our most anticipated event to date was The Dr. Martens Presents Tour in New York. We started the show in the heart of Bushwick with Freakquencee and Big Freedia for a super high-energy dance party at Brooklyn Made. We're so grateful for all the dedicated fans who showed up early and stayed late for an unforgettable night. Then we headed to the Dr. Martens Smith Street store where Control Top, Sorry Mom and Foyer Red played to a rowdy crowd. Per usual, New York will always have our heart.")

Later, Big Freedia did what she does best -- turning the energy all the way up and bringing the house down. The Queen of Bounce, her dancers, and tons of fans took the stage for a night of joy and community.')

In each photo, she is belting into the mic while playing guitar.', 'Sorry Mom & Control Top', 'at Dr. Martens, Smith St. Store', "We popped into our Smith Street store for another killer show. In-between their sets, Control Top spoke to the crowd about the importance of queer community. Sorry Mom vocalist brought her parents to the show, and her mom sang along to all the songs — a true fan. Foyer Red members collectively DJed the evening with nods to Fergie and Britney. The crowd skewed young; for many of them it was their first punk show ever.")
