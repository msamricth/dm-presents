	p.fm-episode-text Rock and roll songstress Lauren Ruth Ward released her album, Vol. II, right as the US went into lockdown in March. But that hasn't stopped Ward from cultivating community, made of fans and fellow musicians, through her work. Featuring gritty, vulnerable lyrics and a old-school rock sensibility, Ward's music draws in admirers from near (like L.A., her current home base) and far.
