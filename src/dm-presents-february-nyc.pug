	+bigImageOneSize("S3E6-NYC/02-collage", 'A collage begins with Binki wearing a striped button-up shirt, tie, beanie, and sunglasses on stage. His arms are open wide and he looks to his right, his image illuminated by the warm yellow and red glow of stage lights. The words "it’s cathartic to be on stage" are overlayed in red across his shoulders, and a square red box with the word "screaming" is positioned on his chest. Beneath is a triptych of Binki from behind, burning money on stage with the audience below laughing. Further down, a black and white image on the left of Nnamdi on stage singing into the microphone with his right arm lifted is overlayed by a red-hued shot of guitar equipment on the floor. An image of two people in the crowd, one of them laughing and the other looking up in awe, overlaps these two images centered at the bottom.', "s3v4")

He wears a jacket, trousers, and loafers with argyle socks. The image is in black and white and his figure has been duplicated so there are two Paw Paw Rods overlapped on the left side and two overlapped on the right, with each duplicate lighter in contrast as if scanned, and in an Andy Warhol pop art style.', 'NNAMDÏ, Binki', 'Bowery Ballroom', "If the show starts at 7pm, what time are you lining up? NNMADÏ and Binki fans gave it 5 hours just to be safe. Once doors opened, the legendary Bowery Ballroom filled up immediately. DJ Talia Goddess got the crowd going before NNMADÏ got on stage and captivated the room with a unique blend of indie rock, jazz, and hip-hop. Being his first ever with a live band, it was a special night for Binki and fans alike. He kept moving to his infectious electronic pop. ")
