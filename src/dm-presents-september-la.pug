	+eventDescription("For our first Dr. Martens Presents Tour stop in L.A. was a celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, folx filled every corner of Dr. Martens Silverlake. Doris Anahí’s voice filled the room and carried out into the streets. She spoke about her family’s love of music and her uncle joined her in a song that had everyone singing along with tears in their eyes.", "We dried our eyes as Reyna Tropical took the stage and brought the bounce back to the room! Reyna Tropical continues to offer joyful reflection and rhythms even after the loss of bandmate Sumo who passed earlier this year. In his honor, his family members wore shirts bearing his name and the message Proxima Estacion Esperanza. At the end of the night the crowd lingered for another drink, another hug, another moment together.")
