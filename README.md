# Dr Martens

> This is a central repo for development of promotional websites for use with Doc Martens CMS

## Usage

> Run `npm i` in the project directory to install dependencies for building & exporting
> Modify files in the `src/` directory to make changes, and then run `gulp export` (see below)

### Gulp tasks 

> The `default` task creates a file in `build/index.html` which can be hosted locally to get an *okay* preview of the content. 

> The `export` task exports a minified blob of html & css that needs to be copy/pasted into Hybris, it places it in `build/export.html`.
